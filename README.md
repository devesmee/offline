Android application (Java) - developed by 11 students - that helps Fontys students to reduce their screentime while at school in an insightful and rewarding way.

**On campus only**

The app detects when you enter / exit campus and will only track your phone usage while you are on campus.

**Set goals**

Students can set a goal for themselves, this goal is set on how much time they wish to be off their phone during their time on campus. This goal can be modified whenever they want.

**Earn rewards**

When a student reaches a certain milestone, they will be presented with a reward in the form of a meme-sticker.

**Gain insights**

Students can view their Daily, Weekly and Monthly Statistics and reflect upon their own behaviour. 

**Gentle nudge to being more productive**

Notifications from unproductive apps will be blocked. Students themselves are responsible as to which apps they set as unproductive.
